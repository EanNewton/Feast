## Steps

1.  Set the yogurt in a small strainer or cheesecloth over a bowl for a few minutes to drain off the excess liquid. Slice the sweet potato crosswise as thinly as possible with a mandoline or a very sharp knife - it is important that the slices be very thin so they cook completely in the oven.
2.  Preheat the oven to 475 F / 240 C and place a rack in the bottom third of the oven. If using a pizza stone, sprinkle a pizza paddle or peel lightly with cornmeal. If using a baking sheet, preheat in the oven until it is very hot and then dust it with cornmeal.
3.  On a well-floured work surface, sprinkle the dough and your hands with flour. Stretch the dough with your hands to make any shape of pizza you please, roughly 12 inches / 30 cm round or oblong, stretching the edges lightly to form a circle, oval or rectangle that is evenly thin throughout the middle. Carefully transfer the dough to the prepared pizza paddle or hot baking sheet with both hands.
4.  Cover the pizza dough with a very thin scattering of Parmigiano-Reggiano to help the sweet potatoes stick, then cover completely with gently overlapping layers of sweet potato. Drizzle with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
5.  If using a pizza stone, slide the pizza onto the stone and place it in the oven. If using a baking sheet, place the hot baking sheet in the oven. Bake until the pizza is puffed, crisp on the bottom, and evenly baked through, 8 to 12 minutes.
6.  Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small pan over low heat; add the sage and continue cooking until the butter forms brown bits on the bottom of the pan and it smells nutty and toasty, about 6 minutes. Remove the sage leaves and discard or, if you really like sage, finely chop and set aside.
7.  Remove the pizza from the oven and dollop with the strained yogurt and drizzle with the browned butter. If you like, add the chopped sage leaves, Serve warm with lime wedges.
