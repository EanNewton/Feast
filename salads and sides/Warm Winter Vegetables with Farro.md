## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 400 F / 200 C
2.  Drizzle the beets with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Wrap them tightly in aluminum foil and roast until they can easily be pierced with a fork, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool in the foil.
3.  Combine the carrots, honey, thyme, and 1 cup / 240 ml water in a medium skillet over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and cook until the vegetables are fork-tender and the broth has reduced to a glaze, about 25 minutes. Remove from the heat and keep warm.
4.  Meanwhile, put the farro in a medium pot and add enough water to cover by about 2 inch / 5 cm. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, reduce to low heat, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain.
5.  When the beets are cool enough to handle, peel the skins with a pairing knife and quarter. Slice the radishes as thinly as possible with a mandoline or a very sharp knife.
6.  To make the dressing, whisk together the yogurt, lime juice, herbs, hazelnut oil, olive oil, 1/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper in a medium bowl. Taste with a leaf of arugula; adjust the salt, pepper, or lime juice as needed.
7.  Divide the farro among the shallow bowls. Drain the carrots. Combine the beets, carrots, and arugula in a large bowl; toss together; and arrange over the farro. Top with the radishes, drizzle with the dressing, and sprinkle with hazelnuts and flaky salt. Generously grate or shave Parmigiano-Reggiano over the top with a vegetable peeler. Serve warm.
