## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 400 F / 200 C
2.  Take two swipes of peel off the orange with a vegetable peeler and set the orange aside. Toss together the carrots, shallots, orange zest, and 3 tbsp of the olive oil in a medium bowl. Season with fine sea salt and pepper, toss again, and spread out on a baking sheet. Roast until the carrots are fork-tender, about 20 minutes.
3.  Place the orange on the cutting board and cut off a little bit from ends to create flat surfaces. Set the orange on one of the flat ends. Using a large, sharp knife, shave off the skin, peel, and as much of the pith as possible along the curve of the fruit. Squeeze any juices from the skin into a small bowl and reserve.
4.  Working over the bowl with the juices with a sharp paring knife, hold the orange in your non-dominant hand to cut the segment along the membrane. Cut along the opposing membrane (in a V), releasing the segment and collecting any juices and the fruit itself in the bowl below. Repeat with all the segments, then squeeze any remaining juices from the membranes and toss.
5.  Whisk together the juice with the remaining 1 tbsp olive oil and the honey. Taste with a tip of radicchio; the dressing should be subtly sweet and not too bitter.
6.  Arrange the radicchio on a platter. Arrange the roasted carrots, shallots, and orange segments over the radicchio and top with the hazelnuts. Drizzle with the dressing and sprinkle with flaked sea salt. Serve immediately.
