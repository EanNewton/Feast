## Instructions

1. Combine the water and a a large pinch of sea slat in a large saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, stir in the oats, and reduce the heat to medium-low. Gently simmer until the oats are just tender, stirring occasionally, about 15 to 20 minutes.

2. Meanwhile, bring a small saucepan half full of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the peas and cook until bright green and just cooked, about 2 minutes. Drain. [^one]

3. Divide the oats among bowls and top with the peas. Grate the Gouda over the top of each bowl. Drizzle with finishing oil and sprinkle with sel gris and pepper. Serve warm.
