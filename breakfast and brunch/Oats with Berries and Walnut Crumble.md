## Instructions

1. Combine the oats, water, milk, and a pinch of salt in a large saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a rapid simmer, then immediately reduce the heat to medium-low. Gently simmer until the oats are just tender, stirring occasionally, 25 to 30 minutes, depending on how much bite you like in your oats. Stir in additional milk, if desired, to thin to the consistency you prefer. Simmer for 5 minutes more.
2. Meanwhile, pulse the walnuts and sugar together in a food processor to make a coarse crumble.
3. Divide the oats among bowls and sprinkle with walnut crumble and top with berries. Serve warm.
