## Steps

1.  Preheat a conventional oven to 425 F (220 C) or a convection oven to 400 F (200 C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
2. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. Using your fingers or a pastry cutter, blend the butter into the flour until its mostly incorporated with some pea-size pieces remaining. Stir in the buttermilk with a fork until the dough just forms.
3. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and turn it over on itself about eight times, until a cohesive dough forms. Pat into a round about 1/2 inch (12mm) thick. Cut into biscuits with a 2 inch (5cm) biscuit or cookie cutter or a thin-rimmed glass. Pat the dough scraps together and cut out any remaining biscuits.
4. Place the biscuits on the prepared baking sheet about 2 inches (5cm) apart. Bake until golden brown and just cooked through but still moist inside, 12 to 15 minutes in a conventional oven or 12 minutes in a convection oven. Serve warm with molasses butter.
