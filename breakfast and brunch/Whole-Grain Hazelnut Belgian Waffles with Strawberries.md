## Instructions

1. Whisk together the whole-wheat flour, all-purpose flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together the buttermilk, eggs, melted butter, and hazelnut oil in another large bowl. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and whisk in the wet ingredients until just combined into a thick batter and no lumps remain. (Be careful not to overmix, which can make the waffles tough.)
2. Preheat the waffle iron on medium heat until hot. To test, splash a drop of water onto the iron; it should sizzle. Brush the iron lightly with melted butter. Scoop about 1/2 cup (125mL) of the batter onto the iron, smoothing it with a spoon, and close the lid. Cook until the iron stops steaming and the waffles are golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Open up the lid and check the color, and cook another minute if needed. Repeat until all the batter is used, adding more melted butter to the waffle iron as needed. Hold the waffles on a rack (rather than stacked) in a low oven oven to keep them warm.
3. Serve the waffles topped with butter, strawberries, hazelnuts, and maple syrup.
