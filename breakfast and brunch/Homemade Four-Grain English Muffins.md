## Steps

1.  Whisk together the whole-wheat flour, bread flour, cornmeal, oats, millet and flax meal in a large bowl.
2.  Put the warm water in a small bowl and sprinkle the yeast over it. Be sure the water is between 105 and 110 F. If it's too hot, the yeast will die; too cool, the yeast won't activate. Watch for the yeast to puff and expand, 2 to 5 minutes
3.  Meanwhile, warm the milk in a small saucepan over medium heat until just about to simmer, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl. Add the honey and stir until dissolved.
4.  Add the yeast mixture, melted butter, 380 g of the flour mixture, the sunflower seeds, and sel gris to the milk and honey.
5.  If making by hand, mix with a wooden spoon until the dough is mostly smooth and slightly wet, 2-3 minutes. Add the remaining flour mixture, 60 g / 1/2 cup at a time, until a soft dough forms, kneading the dough together until it is no longer sticky. Don't worry if it doesn't come together immediately; as you knead the dough, it will form a ball.
6.  If making with a stand mixer, mix with the dough hook attachment on medium-low speed until the dough is mostly smooth and slightly wet, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the remaining flour mixture, 1/2 cup / 60 g at a time, until a soft dough forms, increasing the speed to medium-high until the dough forms a ball with some drag slapping the sides of the bowl and pulling away as it turns, about 5 minutes. Don't worry if it doesn't come together immediately. If you need to, pull the dough away from the sides with a flexible spatula and stick it to the mass on the dough hook.
7.  Lightly oil another large bowl with the olive oil. Transfer the tough to the oiled bowl and turn the dough to coat with the oil. Cover the top of the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise in a warm, draft-free spot until the dough has doubled in size, about 1 hour.
8.  Sprinkle the work surface with flour. Have a sheet of wax paper nearby and sprinkle with the cornmeal.
9.  Punch down the dough and transfer it to the floured surface. Divide the dough into 12 pieces and roll each into a ball. Lay the dough balls on the wax paper, leaving the space between the balls to they have room to expand without touching. Flatten each with your hand just slightly and sprinkle the tops liberally with cornmeal. Cover loosely and let rise in a warm, draft-free spot for 30 minutes.
10.  Preheat the oven to 350 F.
11.  Heat a nonstick or cast-iron griddle or heavy skillet over medium heat until hot. To test, splash a drop of water on the griddle, it should sizzle. Brush the griddle lightly with butter. Gently brush off excess cornmeal from the dough with a dry pastry brush or your hands. Place about half of the dough rounds on the hot griddle. Cook in batches until the bottoms are golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the muffins with a spatula and cook until the second sides are golden brown. Transfer to a baking sheet. Repeat until all the muffins are browned. Bake the muffins until the edges are firm, 22 to 25 minutes.
12.  Transfer to a wire rack to cool just slightly, about 5 minutes. Just before serving, split with a fork or knife and toast until the cut sides are golden brown.

## Cook's note:

When making fresh dough, the best way to tell how much the dough has expanded is to draw a circle with a permanent marker on the plastic wrap around the dough and see much the dough expands beyond the circle.

## Make ahead:

English muffins freeze beautifully. Let them cool completely before wrapping in plastic wrap and then aluminum foil. Freeze for up to 1 month. Defrost and warm in the toaster or toaster oven.
