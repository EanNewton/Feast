## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 325 F. Line an 8 inch square baking pan with parchment paper so that there are overlapping flaps.
2.  Stir together the oats, millet, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, cinnamon, and salt in a medium bowl.
3.  Pulse the pecans and almonds in a food processor until coarsely chopped (it's okay if some nuts are coarsely ground and others a little powdery). Stir into the oat mixture.
4.  Pulse the dates in a food processor until a thick paste forms. Add the maple syrup, honey, and vanilla and pulse until a puree forms. Scrape out the puree with a rubber spatula and stir into the oat mixture. Add the genmaicha tea leaves and continue stirring (your clean hands work best) until the oats and nuts are sticky and coated with the puree. If the mixture doesn't clump together easily, add up to 1 tbsp of maple syrup.
5.  Transfer the granola to the prepared baking pan and press into a smooth, even layer. Bake until just starting to brown around the edges, about 25 minutes. Transfer to the counter to cool slightly in the baking pan, about 15 minutes. Grab the flaps of parchment paper, lift out the whole batch, and transfer to a cutting board. Cut into 8-10 bars while still warm. Let them cool completely and serve at room temperature. Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week.
