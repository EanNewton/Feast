## Instructions

1. Whisk together the whole-wheat flour, semolina flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and 1/4 tsp salt in a large bowl. Whisk together the milk, melted butter, and eggs in another bowl, adding a few extra splashes of milk if you prefer thin pancakes. 
2. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients, and whisk in the wet ingredients until just incorporated into a thick batter with a few lumps. (Be careful not to overmix, which can make the pancakes tough.)
3. Heat a nonstick or cast-iron griddle or heavy skillet over medium heat until hot. To test, splash a drop of water onto the griddle; it should sizzle. Brush the griddle lightly with melted butter. Scoop about 1/3 cup (75mL) of the batter onto the griddle, leaving plenty of space between pancakes for them to spread and be flipped. Cook until the bottoms are set and a few bubbles form around the edges, about 3 minutes. Flip the pancakes with flexible spatula and cook until the bottoms are golden brown, about 1 minute more. 
4. Transfer to a plate and cover loosely to keep warm. Repeat until all the batter is used, adding more melted butter to the griddle as needed. Serve hot with pats of butter, the peaches, and a drizzle of maple syrup.
