## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 475 F and place a rack in the bottom third of the oven. If using a pizza stone, sprinkle a pizza peel or paddle lightly with cornmeal. If using a baking sheet, preheat it in the oven until it is very hot and then dust it with cornmeal.
2.  On a well-floured work surface or the peel or paddle, sprinkle the dough and your hands with flour. Stretch the dough with your hands to make any shape of pizza you please, roughly 12 inches round or oblong, stretching the edges lightly to form a circle, oval, or rectangle that is evenly thin throughout the middle. Carefully transfer the dough to the prepared pizza paddle or hot baking sheet with both hands.
3.  Top the pizza with the cheddar cheese.
4.  If using a pizza stone, slide the pizza onto the hot stone and place it in the oven. If using a baking sheet, place the hot baking sheet in the oven. Bake until the pizza is pale and golden and starting to look crispy, about 8 minutes.
5.  Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the mustard greens and cook until wilted, about 3 minutes. Season with salt.
6.  Open the oven door quickly, pull out the rack, and crack the eggs over the center of the pizza. Bake until the egg whites are set and the yolks are still slightly soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Spread the mustard greens evenly over the pizza. Drizzle with more olive oil, if desired, and sprinkle with smoked sea salt and pepper. Serve warm.
