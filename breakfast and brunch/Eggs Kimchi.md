Serves 1

---

## Ingredients

* 2 large eggs
* 1 tbsp unsalted butter
* 1/2 cup (85g) kimchi, well drained
* cooked sticky rice or toasted bread

---

## Instructions

1. Crack the eggs into a medium bowl and whisk vigorously until light and frothy. Melt the butter in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat.
1. Add the eggs and let them set a little to cook, 1 to 2 minutes. Scoot them back and forth every now and then with a heat-proof spatula until they are just cooked into large curds, about 2 minutes.
1. Add the kimchi and just barely stir into the eggs with the spatula. Cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve the eggs warm, spooned over the rice.
