## Instructions

1. Stir together the lemon zest, lemon juice, and yogurt in a small bowl. Set aside.

2. Combine the oats, water, milk, cinnamon stick, and a pinch of salt in a large saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a rapid simmer, then immediately reduce the heat to medium-low. Gently simmer until the oats are just tender, stirring occasionally, 25 to 30 minutes, depending on how much bite you like in your oats. Stir in additional milk, if desired, to thin to the consistency you prefer. Simmer for 5 minutes more. Remove the cinnamon stick and discard.

3. Divide the oats among bowls. Grate fresh pear over the top of your oats, peels and all. Top with the pecans and a dollop or two of lemon yogurt. Serve warm.
