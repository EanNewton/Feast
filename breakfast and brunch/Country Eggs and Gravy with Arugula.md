## Ingredients

* 3 tbsp unsalted butter
* 6 oz (160 g) soy breakfast sausage patties (optional)
* 1/4 cup (30 g) all-purpose flour
* 3 cups (720 mL) whole milk
* 8 to 10 large eggs
* Sel gris
* Freshly ground pepper
* 1/4 tsp sweet, hot, or smoked paprika
* Handful arugula

---

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 F / 165 C / Gas 4. Melt 2 tbsp of the butter in an 8 to 10 inch / 20 to 25 cm skillet (preferably cast-iron) over medium-high heat. Add the sausage patties (if using) and cook until crisp on the outside and warmed through, 4 to 6 minutes. Crumble into pieces and leave in the skillet.
2. Sprinkle the flour over the fat in the pan and reduce the heat to medium. Cook stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until the flour is toasted and brown, about 3 minutes. Raise the heat to medium-high and gradually add the milk, whisking constantly until it is all added. Continue to cook, without stirring, until the milk begins to bubble and thicken slightly, about 3 minutes. Turn off the heat. (The gravy will thicken further in the oven.)
3. Break the eggs into the gravy, evenly spaced around the skillet. Bake until the whites are just cooked through and the yolks are still slightly soft, 10 to 15 minutes. Sprinkle with sel gris and pepper.
4. Meanwhile, melt the remaining 1 tbsp butter in a small skillet over low heat and add the paprika. Let the paprika butter toast until fragrant and slightly toasty red, about 1 minute.
5. Sprinkle the arugula over the top of the eggs and gravy and drizzle with the spiced butter. Serve hot.
