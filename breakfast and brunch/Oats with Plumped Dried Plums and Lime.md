## Instructions

1. Combine the oats, water, milk, cinnamon stick, and a pinch of salt in a large saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a rapid simmer, then immediately reduce the heat to medium-low. Gently simmer until the oats are just tender, stirring occasionally, 25 to 30 minutes, depending on how much bite you like in your oats. Stir in additional milk, if desired, to thin to the consistency you prefer. Simmer for 5 minutes more. Remove the cinnamon stick and discard.

2. Meanwhile, combine the dried plums and prune juice in a shallow pan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, cover, and reduce the heat to low. Gently simmer until the plums are soft and plump and the juices are slightly thickened, 8 to 12 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside, reserving the plums in their juices.

3. Divide the oats among bowls. Spoon the plumped plums over the top of your oats. Top with a dollop or two of yogurt. Sprinkle with lime zest and squeeze fresh lime juice over the top. Serve warm.
