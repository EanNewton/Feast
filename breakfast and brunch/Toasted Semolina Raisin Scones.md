## Instructions

1. Preheat a conventional oven to 375F/190C/Gas 5 or a convection oven to 350F/180C/Gas 4. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Whisk together the all purpose flour, whole wheat flour, semolina flour, 2 to 3 tbsp sugar (depending on how sweet you like your scones), baking powder, lemon zest, anise seeds, and sel gris in a large bowl. Using your fingers or a pastry cutter, blend the butter cubes into the flour until it is mostly incorporated with some pea-size pieces of butter remaining. Stir in the raisins and milk with a fork until the dough just forms.
3. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Gently pat (without kneading) the dough into a round about 3/4in/2cm thick and 6in/15cm across. Using a sharp knife or bench scraper, cut the round into six wedges.
4. Place the scones on the prepared baking sheet, leaving a bit of space between them and refrigerate for 15 minutes
5. Brush the top of the scones with milk and lightly sprinkle with sugar. Bake until golden brown and cooked through but still moist inside, 15 to 18 minutes in a conventional oven or 14 minutes in a convection oven. When fully cooked, the scones should feel firm on the outside. It's okay to cut into one to test the doneness of the inside. If the scones are a touch undercooked, turn off the  oven and let them remain in the oven for 5 minutes more -- my secret for the best texture, with a crispy, crunchy outside and moist, tender inside. Transfer to a wire rack to cool for 15 minutes.
6. Serve warm with butter and orange marmalade.
