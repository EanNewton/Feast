## Instructions

1. Combine the oats, water, milk, and a pinch of salt in a large saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a rapid simmer, then immediately reduce the heat to medium-low. Gently simmer until the oats are just tender, stirring occasionally, 25 to 30 minutes, depending on how much bite you like in your oats. Stir in additional milk, if desired, to thin to the consistency you prefer. Simmer for 5 minutes more.
2. Divide the oats among bowls and top with strawberries and a dollop of yogurt. Drizzle with molasses. Serve warm.
