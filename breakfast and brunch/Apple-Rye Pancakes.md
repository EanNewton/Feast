## Instructions

1. Whisk together the all-purpose flour, rye flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together the eggs, buttermilk, and melted butter in another large bowl. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients, and whisk in the wet ingredients until just incorporated into a thick batter with a few lumps.
2. Slice the apple as thinly as possible with a mandolin or a very sharp knife, stopping when you hit the core and starting again from the other side.
3. Warm the syrup in a small saucepan over low heat. Add the whisky (if desired) stir to combine, and keep warm over low heat while making the pancakes.
4. Heat a nonstick or cast-iron griddle or heavy skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Brush the griddle lightly with melted butter. Scoop about 1/3 cup (75mL) of the batter onto the griddle, leaving plenty of space between pancakes for them to spread and be flipped. Cook until the bottoms are set and a few bubbles form around the edges, about 3 minutes. Lay a few apple slices on top of each pancake. Add a little more butter to the pan.
5. Flip the pancakes with a flexible spatula and cook until the second sides are golden brown and the apple a touch crisp, about 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate and cover loosely to keep warm. Repeat until all the batter is used, adding more melted butter to the griddle as needed. Serve hot, apple-side up, with butter and a drizzle of warm syrup.
