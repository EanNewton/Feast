## Instructions

1. Stir together the 2 cups (250g) masarepa, sugar, and 1/4 tsp salt in a medium bowl. Add the warm milk, butter, and queso anejo and stir with a wooden spoon or fork until a thick dough forms. Feel the dough; it should be soft. Add up to 2 tbsp more masarepa and stir together until incorporated. Scoop the dough into eight or ten equal portions and put on a floured work surface. Flatten each with your hand into a small patty about 1/2 inch / 12mm thick.
2. Heat a cast-iron griddle or nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until hot. To test, splash a drop of wtaer onto the griddle; it should drizzle. Add 1 tbsp oil and fry the plantain slices until golden and crisp like thin potato chips, about 6 minutes, turning once. Season with salt and set aside.
3. Brush the griddle lightly with another 1 tbsp oil. Place the patties on the griddle, leaving space between them to flip. Cook until a light brown crust forms on one side, 3 to 4 minutes more. Season lightly with salt while warm, transfer to a platter, and cover loosely to keep warm. Repeat until all of the arepas are cooked, adding more oil to the griddle as needed.'
4. Dollop Garlicky Green Sauce over each arepa, and top with plantain chips, queso anejo, and avocado. Serve hot with additional sauce at the table.

## Notes

1. True arepas are made with masarepa, or fine white corn flour, but masa harina, the same cornmeal used to make tortillas, is easier to find and is a good substitue.
