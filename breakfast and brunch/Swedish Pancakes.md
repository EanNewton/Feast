## Steps

1. Combine the milk, eggs, melted butter, vanilla, and a pinch of salt in a blender or bowl with an immersion blender and puree until smooth, about 1 minute. Gradually add the flour, continuing to puree, until the batter is smooth and the consistency of heavy cream, about 2 minutes more.
2. Preheat a nonstick crepe pan or well-seasoned cast-iron griddle over medium heat until hot. To test, splash a drop of water onto the pan; it should sizzle. Add a little melted butter to the pan.
3. Pour 1/3 cup (75 mL) of the batter onto the hot pan, twirling the pan to coat the bottom with a thin, even layer of batter. If you're using a griddle, pour the batter and quickly smooth into a thing, even layer (it can be round or square) with an offset spatula. The batter should start cooking rather quickly. If not, raise the heat slightly. (If the batter is browning too quickly, reduce the heat slightly.)
4. Cook until the batter changes from shiny to dull and the pancake bottom is slightly bubbly and lightly brown, about 3 minutes. Roll up each pancake into a cylinder with a fork or offset spatula, and transfer to a plate to hold. Repeat until all the batter is used, adding more melted butter to the pan as needed (it's usually not necessary if using a nonstick pan), and cover the pancakes loosely as you go to keep them warm.
5. Serve warm, with butter and lingonberry jam.
