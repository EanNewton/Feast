## Steps

1.  Heat the 2 tbsp olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the green onions and cook until soft, about 3 minutes. Raise the heat to medium-high, add the bell peppers, and continue to cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and red pepper flakes and continue cooking until some of the liquid from the tomatoes has evaporated, about 10 minutes.
2.  Meanwhile, place the pita on an open flame on the stove top, turning with long metal tongs, until toasted and warmed on all sides. Cover loosely to keep warm.
3.  Crack the eggs into a medium bowl and whisk vigorously until light and frothy. Add the remaining 1 tsp olive oil to the pan. Add the eggs and let them set a little to cook, 2 to 3 minutes. Scoot them back and forth every now and then with a heat-proof spatula until they are just cooked into large curds, but still a touch runny, about 3 minutes. Add the salt and season with black pepper. Remove from the heat, stir in the parsley, and sprinkle the feta over the top.
4.  Serve hot with green olives and the pita.
