## Steps

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Set the bowl of ice water next to the sink. Add the green beans to the boiling water and cook until bright green and crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer them to the ice water with a slotted spoon, drain and pat dry.
2. Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven or a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic and cook to soften, 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook until they release their juice, 2 minutes more. Stir in the Gigantes and blanched green beans and cook to warm through. Break the feta over the top and sprinkle with freshly ground pepper. Serve straight from the Dutch oven, or spoon into shallow bowls, with lemon wedges and crust bread.
