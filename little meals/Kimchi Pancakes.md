## Steps

1.  Drain the kimchi in a colander, pressing with a wooden spoon to get out as much liquid as possible. Chop the kimchi.
2. Quarter the white and light green parts of the green onions lengthwise and cut into 2-in / 5-cm lengths.
3. ***To make the soy dipping sauce:*** Stir together the soy sauce and rice vinegar in a small serving bowl. Sprinkle the sliced green onions on top.
4. Whisk together the flour, egg, seltzer, sesame oil, and salt in a large bowl. Add the kimchi, halibut (if using), and the quartered green onions and stir together.
5. Heat 1 tbsp of the vegetable oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Pour half of the batter evenly into the skillet, spreading it into an even layer with a flexible spatula. Cook until the bottom is deep golden and crispy around the edges, about 4 minutes. Carefully flip the pancake and continue to cook until the second side is golden and cooked through, about 3 minutes more. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding the remaining 1 tbsp oil to the skillet.
6. Cut the pancakes into wedges. Serve hot with the dipping sauce.
