## Steps

1.  Combine the chickpeas, tahini, garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, and za'atar in a food processor and process until smooth, about 5 minutes. (Add a bit of the cooking liquid or water as needed to reach your desired consistency.) Taste and season with salt.
2.  Spoon the hummus into a shallow serving bowl while still slightly warm. Top with a dollop of Greek yogurt and drizzle with finishing oil. Sprinkle the paprika and parsley over the top. Serve with warmed pita bread.

## Cook's note

When you make hummus from scratch, it's worth it to make a lot, but this recipe can be easily halved. Even if you just plan to make half the recipe, go ahead and soak and cook a whole bag of chickpeas and use any remainders in Spring Vegetable Paella (see: ) or Lentil-Chickpea Burgers with Harissa Yogurt (see: ).
