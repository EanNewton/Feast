## Ingredients

* 10 oz fresh or frozen peas
* 1/4 cup evoo

## Steps

1.  Bring a medium saucepan three-fourths full of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the peas and cook until bright green and just cooked, about 2 minutes. Drain, reserving about 1/3 cup of the cooking liquid. Puree the cooked peas, the reserved cooking liquid, and the olive oil with an immersion blender or food processor to create a slightly chunky puree.
2.  Spoon the warm puree onto two to four plates. Top with the burrata and a drizzle of finishing oil. Top with mint and sprinkle with sel gris and pepper. Serve warm with baguette slices.


## Note
Burrata is like mozzarella, but with a creamier, almost custard-like center that melts on the plate and in your mouth. If you can't find it locally, use the freshest mozzarella you can find. For the best flavor, serve burrata or mozzarella at room temperature.
