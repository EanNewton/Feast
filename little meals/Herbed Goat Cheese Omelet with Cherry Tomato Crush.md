* 1 tbsp evoo
* Heaping handful red and yellow Sweet 100s or cherry tomatoes

* salt and pepper
* 1 tbsp herbed goat cheese

## Steps

1.  Crack the eggs into a medium bowl and whisk vigorously until light and frothy.
2.  Heat the olive oil in a small skillet. Add the tomatoes and cook until the skins are toasted, about 2 minutes. Add a splash or two of water, cover, and cook until most of the tomatoes burst, about 1 minute more. Remove from the heat.
3.  Melt the butter in another small nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Add the leek and asparagus to the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
4.  Add the eggs to the skillet with the leeks and asparagus and let them set a little to cook, about 1 minute. Gently push one edge of the eggs to the center of the pan with a heat-proof flexible spatula, tilting the pan to allow any liquid to flow underneath. Repeat two or three times around the edges of the omelet, until most of the eggs are set and omelet looks like a bright yellow pancake.
5.  Loosen the omelet from the edges of the pan with you spatula so that it will slide out of the pan easily later. Add the goat cheese to half of the omelet and cover with a lid until it melts, about 30 seconds. Lift one edge of the omelet with the spatula and fold it over the other half so that the curved edges line up in a half-moon. Gently slide the omelet into a plate and garnish with the cherry tomatoes. Serve warm.
